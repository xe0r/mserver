This media server uses ffmpeg to transcode files to webm, allowing
them to be played in a HTML5 web browser, useful for sharing videos
in home network.

To run copy sample-config.json to config.json, place video directory paths there,
and type "go run main.go".
Alternatively, type "go build" and run the executable.
When the server is running, use web browser to access it.
